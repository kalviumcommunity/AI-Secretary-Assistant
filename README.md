# ü§ñ AI Secretary

**AI Secretary** is a full-stack AI-powered assistant built using modern web technologies and the Gemini/OpenAI API. It acts as your **personal productivity partner**, helping with:

* Writing emails  
* Building code  
* Generating documents  
* Automating repetitive tasks

Users can input instructions or upload documents (briefs, notes, requirements), and the assistant completes the tasks **intelligently using that context‚Äîno supervision needed.**

## üîß Core Concepts

### üß† Prompting

* Dynamic, structured prompts help the LLM (Gemini or GPT-4) understand user intent.
* Prompts are adapted to task types (e.g., email, code, summary).
* Uploaded files or user input are used for enhanced context and relevance.

### üìä Structured Output

* Outputs are returned in clean, structured `JSON` or `Markdown`.
* This supports seamless integration into UI components or automation tools.

**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "task": "email",
  "to": "hr@example.com",
  "subject": "Delay Notification",
  "body": "Dear HR, I would like to inform you that..."
}
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Function Calling

* Enables real-world automation from AI-generated output.
* Backend functions include:
  * Sending emails  
  * Generating PDFs  
  * Creating to-do lists  
  * Scheduling meetings  
* Functions are passed into the model, which decides when and how to use them.

### üîç RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

* Improves accuracy for personalized or document-based questions.
* How it works:
  * Uploaded files are chunked and stored in a vector database.
  * On query, relevant chunks are retrieved by similarity search.
  * Retrieved content is included in the prompt for grounded, factual responses.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Stack

* **Frontend:** React or Vite + TailwindCSS  
* **Backend:** Node.js (Express or Next.js API Routes)  
* **LLM:** Gemini API / OpenAI GPT-4  
* **RAG:** Local Vector DB (e.g., Chroma, Weaviate, in-memory)  
* **Auth:** JWT-based session handling  
* **File Upload:** Upload ‚Üí Parse ‚Üí Chunk ‚Üí Store for context building

## ‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria

### ‚úîÔ∏è Correctness

* All answers are grounded in user-uploaded documents or inputs.
* Function calling ensures output is accurately interpreted and executed.

### ‚ö° Efficiency

* Chunked documents and templated prompts optimize performance.
* Local vector search reduces latency.

### üìà Scalability

* Modular and serverless-friendly (Vercel, Render).
* Vector DB and function handler components scale independently.
* Gemini/OpenAI APIs scale naturally for production usage.

## Prompting 

### Zero Shot Prompting 

  A zero shot prompting means giving a task of AI without providing examples or other information , it relies the pre-trained model to respond to your question

 * Translate "What is your name ?" in Russian - Text Transformation
 * How is the weather today in Delhi - Information Retrival 
 * Write a poem on nature - Creative Task
 * What is the answer to 147^89 ? - Reason & Problem Solving

### One Shot Prompting

One shot prompting means giving one example of task to AI in your prompt before asking it to perform the same task on a new input.

## 1) Sentiment Classification

* **Input-1:** This is some good food
* **Output-1:** Positive

Now classify:

* **Input-2:** The food didn't have the warmth
* **Output-2:** [To be completed by AI]

## 2) Summarization

* **Text:** "The sun rises in the east and sets in the west."
* **Summary:** "Sun moves east to west."

Now summarize:

* **Text:** "Water boils at 100¬∞C under standard atmospheric pressure."
* **Summary:** [To be completed by AI]

## 3) Reasoning

* **Problem:** 12 + 8 = ?
* **Answer:** 20

Now solve:

* **Problem:** 25 - 9 = ?
* **Answer:** [To be completed by AI]
